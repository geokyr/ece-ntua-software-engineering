# test-api

## Disclaimer

* Due to limitations from the **jest** testing framework, test suites have to be inside the **/api** folder.

* The **apitesting.test.js** file present in this folder is a copy of the file used for testing that resides in the **/api/test_api** folder. It is **not** used during testing.

## Instructions

* In the **/api** folder run:
```
$ npm run test_api
```
